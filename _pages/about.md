Hello! I'm a 3rd year PhD student at the University of California, Santa Cruz working with [Tamara Pico](https://tamarapico.github.io/) and [Emily Brodsky](https://seismo.sites.ucsc.edu/emily-brodsky/).

## Research Interests

My research currently focuses on:

- **Internal Waves**: Decadal analysis on internal waves in the South China Sea using seafloor instrumentation and remote sensing
- **Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA)**: Investigating GIA-induced stress changes on the Queen Charlotte Fault over the last deglaciation (26 ka)

## Background

I earned my BSc. in Geophysics with a minor in Applied Math from the [Department of Earth and Space Sciences](https://www.ess.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. During my time there, I conducted research with [Brad Lipovsky](https://bradlipovsky.github.io/) in the Environmental Geophysics and Computation research group.

In 2022, I completed an internship on the Matanuska Glacier in Alaska. During the internship, I led multiple 3-mile glacier hikes each day, guiding tourists and researchers through the glacial terrain. My responsibilities included ensuring the safety of the participants, as well as providing them with insights into glacial features and history.

I am currently at UCSC working with Emily Brodsky & Tamara Pico on Internal Waves and GIA.
