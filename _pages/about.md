Hello! I'm a current PhD student at the University of California, Santa Cruz working with [Tamara Pico](https://tamarapico.github.io/) and [Emily Brodsky](https://seismo.sites.ucsc.edu/emily-brodsky/). 
My research is currently focused on:

- Analyzing oceanic internal waves in the South China Sea using satellite and OBS data
- Calculating glacial isostatic adjustement (GIA) induced stress changes on the Queen Charlotte Fault

I completed my BSc. in Geophysics with a minor in Applied Math in the [Department of Earth and Space Sciences](https://www.ess.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, where I did research under [Brad Lipovsky](https://bradlipovsky.github.io/) in the Environmental Geophysics and Computation research group.
