## About Me

Hello! I'm a current PhD student at the University of California, Santa Cruz working with [Tamara Pico](https://tamarapico.github.io/) and [Emily Brodsky](https://seismo.sites.ucsc.edu/emily-brodsky/). 

## Research Interests

My research focuses on:

- **Oceanic Internal Waves**: Analyzing the velocity of internal waves in the South China Sea using satellite and OBS data.
- **Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA)**: Investigating GIA-induced stress changes on the Queen Charlotte Fault over miliion-year timescales.

## Educational Background

I completed my BSc. in Geophysics with a minor in Applied Math in the [Department of Earth and Space Sciences](https://www.ess.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, where I did conducted research with [Brad Lipovsky](https://bradlipovsky.github.io/) in the Environmental Geophysics and Computation research group.
