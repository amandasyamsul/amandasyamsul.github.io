I am a undergraduate student in the [Department of Earth and Space Sciences](https://www.ess.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington majoring in Geophysics with a minor in Applied Math. I'm doing research under [Professor Brad Lipovsky](https://bradlipovsky.github.io/) in the Environmental Geophysics and Computation research group.

My recent research interests include:
* Surface load induced seismicity and solid Earth-fluid Earth interactions
* Glacial isostatic adjustment and its relation to faulting and slow slip
