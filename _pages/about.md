Hello! I'm a 3rd year PhD student at the University of California, Santa Cruz working with [Emily Brodsky](https://seismo.sites.ucsc.edu/emily-brodsky/) and [Tamara Pico](https://tamarapico.github.io/).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on seismic expressions of climate variability, by analyzing climate-solid Earth interactions across timescales & phenomena.

- **Internal Waves and Ocean Seismology**: Characterizing ocean stratification with internal waves using seafloor pressure and seismic instrumentation
- **Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) & Sea Level Modeling**: Investigating GIA-induced stress changes on the Queen Charlotte Fault over the last deglaciation (26 ka)

## About me

I earned my BSc. in Geophysics with a minor in Applied Math from the [Department of Earth and Space Sciences](https://www.ess.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington (UW). During my time there, I conducted research with [Brad Lipovsky](https://bradlipovsky.github.io/) in the Environmental Geophysics and Computation research group. Our work focused on surface load induced seismicity (publication in review, 2025). While at UW, I worked at the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network organizing earthquake outreach and hazard preparedness for local communities.

In 2022, I completed an internship on the Matanuska Glacier in Alaska. During the internship, I led multiple glacier hikes each day, guiding tourists and researchers through the glacial terrain. My responsibilities included ensuring the safety of the participants, as well as providing them with insights into glacial features and history.

I am currently at UCSC working in the [Seismology Lab](https://seismo.sites.ucsc.edu/) and [Pico Group](https://tamarapico.github.io/)!
