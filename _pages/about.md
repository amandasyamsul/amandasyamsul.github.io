I am a undergraduate student in the [Department of Earth and Space Sciences](https://www.ess.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington majoring in Geophysics with a minor in Applied Math. I'm doing research under [Professor Brad Lipovsky](https://bradlipovsky.github.io/) in the Environmental Geophysics and Computation research group.

My current research interests are seismology, glaciology, and solid Earth-fluid Earth interactions.
